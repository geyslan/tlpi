### 6-1

> Compile the program in Listing 6-1 ( mem_segments.c ), and list its size using ls â€“l. Although the program contains an array (mbuf) that is around 10 MB in size, the executable file is much smaller than this. Why is this?

- It's because `mbuf` symbol is allocated in the uninitialized data segment (bss - block started by symbol). But don't be confused, even if `mbuf` is in the uninitialized data segment, the content that this symbol references is zeroed, as it's `static` and not `auto`matic.
